# On-Air Virtual Devices

This project aims to create virtual devices such as a mouse, keyboard, and canvas using **OpenCV** and **Artificial Intelligence**. The primary objective of the project is to make these devices accessible to people with finger impairments so that they can work without touch or press. The project uses computer vision techniques to track hand movements and recognize hand tips, which are then used to control the virtual devices. 

The virtual mouse application is designed to provide a hands-free experience for users, allowing them to control their computer without any physical peripheral required. The project also includes a virtual keyboard that can be used to type without touching the keys. Finally, the virtual canvas allows users to draw and paint using hand gestures.

## Folder Structure

The project has the following folder structure:

```
virtual-devices/
├── mouse.py
├── keyboard.py
├── canvas.py
└── requirements.txt
```

## Installation

To install the required dependencies for this project, run the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the virtual devices, simply run the corresponding Python script in your terminal. The scripts are named `mouse.py`, `keyboard.py`, and `canvas.py`. 

The virtual mouse application allows you to control your computer's cursor using hand gestures. To use it, run the `mouse.py` script and follow the on-screen instructions.

The virtual keyboard application allows you to type without touching the keys. To use it, run the `keyboard.py` script and follow the on-screen instructions.

The virtual canvas application allows you to draw and paint using hand gestures. To use it, run the `canvas.py` script and follow the on-screen instructions.
